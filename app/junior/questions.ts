      question: "What is encapsulation?",
      answer:
        "Encapsulation is a principle of object-oriented programming (OOP) that implies each object should maintain its own private internal state and provide public methods to access it. This means that objects can be considered black boxes that have a clear public interface and a hidden internal implementation. Encapsulation helps protect code from being accidentally altered and makes the code easier to understand and maintain.",

      question: "List the advantages of microservices architecture.",
      answer:
        "Some of the advantages of microservices architecture include scalability, resilience, faster deployment, and technology independence. By breaking an application into smaller, independent services, each service can be scaled individually to meet user demand. Additionally, if one service fails, it won't affect the entire application, making it more resilient. Faster deployment is possible because each service can be deployed independently of the others. Finally, technology independence allows each service to use the most appropriate technology for the task it is performing.",

      id: 15,
      question: "What are reducers in Redux?",
      answer:
        "In Redux, reducers are pure functions that take the current state of the application and an action and return a new state. Reducers are used to update the application state in response to user actions. They should not modify the original state of the application but should return an updated copy of the state.",

    {
      id: 19,
      question: "What is an interface in TypeScript?",
      answer:
        "In TypeScript, an interface is a contract that defines the properties and methods that an object must have. It does not define the implementation of the methods, only the structure that an object must follow. Interfaces can be used to define types on variables, parameters, and function returns. Additionally, interfaces are also used to establish a contract between different parts of a system, allowing better communication between them.",

      id: 20,
      question: "What is the meaning of Mock?",
      answer:
        "In programming, mock (or mock object) is a simulated object that is used to test the behavior of other objects in a system. It is used to create controlled and predictable testing scenarios, where different situations can be simulated and observe how the system behaves. Mocks are useful in unit and integration testing as they allow isolating the code being tested from other parts of the system.",

      question: "What is the Virtual DOM? What is its advantage?",
      answer:
        "The Virtual DOM is a technique used in frameworks like React, where a virtual representation of the element tree is created in memory. This representation is compared with the actual DOM tree, and only the differences are updated in the user interface. This allows updates to be made more efficiently, reducing the amount of operations needed to update the user interface.",

      id: 23,
      question: "23. What is and how to use the Block Element Modifier (BEM) convention?",
      answer:
        'The Block Element Modifier (BEM) convention is a CSS class naming methodology that helps make code more organized and easier to maintain. Each class is divided into three parts: the block (an independent component), the element (a part of the component), and the modifier (a variation of the element). For example, a button could be represented as ".button", a shopping cart icon inside the button could be represented as ".button__cart", and an active button could be represented as ".button--active".',
